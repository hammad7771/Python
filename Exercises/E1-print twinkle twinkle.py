# For printing something in python you need to write function print()
# and put the string inside the "" or '' but if you want to put integer or Float 
# on it simply just write print function and put the value inside it 
# without quotes like: print(5) or print(4.5)

print('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!\n'
      '\t\tUp above the world so high,\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky\n'
      'Twinkle, twinkle, little star\n\tHow I wonder what you are')
